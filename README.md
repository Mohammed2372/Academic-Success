# Academic Success Prediction

Welcome to the Academic Success Prediction project! This project aims to predict the academic risk of students in higher education, helping institutions identify students who may be at risk of not graduating or dropping out.

## Overview

In this project, we use machine learning techniques to analyze various factors that contribute to student academic success. By leveraging historical data on student demographics, academic performance, and other relevant features, we build a classification model to predict whether a student will graduate, enroll for the next term, or drop out.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project contains information about students in higher education, including demographic attributes, academic performance metrics, socio-economic factors, and other relevant features. The target variable is the academic outcome, which can be one of the following classes:

- Graduated
- Enrolled
- Dropped

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

* git clone https://github.com/your_username/academic-success-prediction.git
* cd Academic-Success

## Usage

To train the model and make predictions, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly and contains all necessary features.
2. Train the model: Use machine learning algorithms to train a classification model on the dataset.
3. Evaluate the model: Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
4. Make predictions: Use the trained model to predict the academic outcome of new students.
